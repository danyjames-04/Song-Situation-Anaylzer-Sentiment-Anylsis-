## 🧠 Project Description

Ever felt like your music taste deserves psychological evaluation?  
Our app fetches lyrics of any song you enter and tells you which meme perfectly represents the emotional chaos within it.

---

## 🚨 The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People don’t know how to *meme-ify* their feelings after listening to an emotional bop.  
A tragic oversight in modern society.

---

## 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We use AI to classify emotions from lyrics and assign a meme that reflects your deepest song-induced trauma or power fantasy.  
Completely unnecessary. Absolutely glorious.
